# Suits
Suits Card Game

A simple and easy card game, normally played as drinking game.

## How to Play

* The `magic number` each round is the number of players minus 1.
* One person picks a suit out of clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
* Click draw and four cards will appear.
* If the picked suit is within any of the cards, the drawer gives out drinks for the number of cards with that suit times the magic number.
* If the picked suit is not within any of the cards, the draw must drink the magic number times 2.
* You then move onto a new drawer, typically in a circle format.

## Example

There are 5 players, `Ben`, `Beth`, `Cam`, `Connor` and `Kyle`. Therefore the magic number is 4.
`Ben` goes first, chooses spades, and clicks draw.
The cards drawn are 8 of spades, 5 of spades, king of spades and 10 of hearts.
As there are 2 spade cards, `Ben` gets to give out 12 drinks (3 * 4).
He is generous and gives out 3 to each player.
`Beth` goes second, chooses hearts, and clicks draw.
The cards drawn are 2 of clubs, jack of diamonds, king of diamonds and 10 of spades.
As there are no hearts, `Beth` must drink 8 times (2 * 4 - the magic number times 2).

## Additional Rules

You cannot give a player more than 10 drinks per round.
On the final round, all numbers are doubled (`Ben` would have had 24 drinks to give out for example) and the above rule is canceled.
