Suits Card Game

CURRENT BUILD
Displays four cards, but then ends. You have to reset the page and start afresh.

A simple and easy card game, normally played as drinking game.

How to Play

The magic number each round is the number of players minus 1.
On person picks a suit out of clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
Click draw and four cards will appear.
If the picked suit is within any of the cards, the drawer gives out drinks for the number of cards with that suit times the magic number.
If the picked suit is not within any of the cards, the draw must drink the magic number times 2.
You then move onto a new drawer, typically in a circle format.

Example

There are 5 players, Ben, Beth, Cam, Connor and Kyle. Therefore the magic number is 4.
Ben goes first, chooses spades, and clicks draw.
The cards drawn are 8 of spades, 5 of spades, king of spades and 10 of hearts.
As there are 2 spade cards, Ben gets to give out 12 drinks (3 * 4).
He is generous and gives out 3 to each player.
Beth goes second, chooses hearts, and clicks draw.
The cards drawn are 2 of clubs, jack of diamonds, king of diamonds and 10 of spades.
As there are no hearts, Beth must drink 8 times (2 * 4 - the magic number times 2).

Additional Rules

You cannot give a player more than 10 drinks per round.
On the final round, all numbers are doubled (Ben would have had 24 drinks to give out for example) and the above rule is canceled.
